Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/lpomazal/CSE341/tree/master/academindCourse

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
I think it is all functioning, I had some issues with my localhost and getting git to sync properly.
 However as it stands the code shows no errors that I can find

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I like how the MVC allows for better code recycling and I am getting more used to using the ejs. Although it still feels a bit 
clunky to use because it is new. 
6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
nothing this made more sense then previous weeks. 
7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

Honestly I don't feel confident enough to be overly creative, plus in the current videos the most creative thing that we can really do
is change the colors on the page and I don't find that overly interesting.
